oltage load forecasting plays a vital role in modern power systems by predicting future voltage or electrical load behavior using historical data. This project utilizes a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network, a type of recurrent neural network designed to handle time-series data and long-term dependencies effectively. The model learns temporal patterns, trends, and non-linear relationships present in voltage and load data. By providing accurate short- and long-term forecasts, this approach helps improve power system planning, voltage stability, demand management, and overall grid reliability.
